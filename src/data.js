        for firing the M-388 nuclear projectile that was deployed by the United States during the Cold War.\
        It was one of the smallest nuclear weapon systems ever built, and was developed for use against Soviet\
        and North Korean armor and troops in case war broke out in Europe or the Korean peninsula. The M-388 round\
        used a version of the Mk-54 warhead, a very small sub-kiloton fission device. Tested under the code-name\
        Little-Feller nuclear test."

        Its components were fabricated at three different plants so that no one would have a copy of the\
        complete design. After the war ended, it was not expected that the inefficient Little Boy design\
        would ever again be required, and many plans and diagrams were destroyed."

        The Fat Man was retired in 1950."

        comes from nuclear fusion, also known as a hydrogen bomb. It was detonated as part of Operation Ivy.\
        It was the first full test of the Teller–Ulam design, a staged fusion device.Due to its physical size\
        and fusion fuel type(cryogenic liquid deuterium), the Mike device was not suitable for use as a deliverable weapon.\
        In fact, the 82-ton device was essentially a building that resembled a factory rather than a weapon.\
        At its center, a very large cylindrical thermos flask or cryostat held the cryogenic deuterium fusion fuel.\
        A regular fission bomb at one end was used to create the conditions needed to initiate the fusion reaction."

        accident in connection with nuclear testing. \
        The unanticipated yield,\
        and a change in the weather, resulted in nuclear fallout spreading eastward onto\
        the inhabited Rongelap and Rongerik atolls, which were soon evacuated.\
        Many of the Marshall Islands natives have since suffered from birth defects and have received\
        some compensation from the federal government of the United States. A Japanese fishing boat,\
        the Daigo Fukuryū Maru, also came into contact with the fallout, which caused many of the crew to grow ill;\
