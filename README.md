# Blast Projector
 * An educational vanilla javascript application that shows the statistical outcomes of a nuclear bomb detonation based on parameters of a bomb, such as yeild and surface/airbust. 
 
 * Uses google maps api to allow user to choose the location of detonation
 
 # Features to be Implemented:
  * Use google maps js API to draw polygons representing the size of the airburst, thermal radiation, incident radiation, etc. based on data interpolation. 
  
  * Make a RESTful API call to a database containing information of population density relative to marker location. This will determine casualties resulting from the detonation
